# Are.na Api Playground

This playground is meant to help better understand how the Are.na API / V2 functions and how the responses might look. I hope this can help anyone who is interested in making things or is just curious. I started this project to try and get better at writing better code, I would greatly appreciate any feedback I can get on how to improve!

## Acknowledgements

This Playground is heavily influenced the beautifully written libraries: [arena-ts](https://github.com/e-e-e/arena-ts) and [arena-js](https://github.com/ivangreene/arena-js). The structure of building the queries as well as how the Api works was fully constructed by reading the code in those libraries, many thanks to the authors! 

## Usage

Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely be removed once you clone a template.

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```
